A list is mutable, meaning its contents can be changed after creation—you can add, remove, or update items. It uses square brackets ([]) and is more flexible but generally slower in performance and consumes more memory. Lists also offer more built-in methods, such as append(), which makes them ideal for tasks like data cleaning or manipulation where the data may change.\n",
